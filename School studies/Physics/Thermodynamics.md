Internal Energy = Kinetic Energy + Potential Energy

### For Ideal Gas![[Kinetic Energy Distribution of Ideal Gases]]

F = PA
If piston moves by distance dx

W = F dx
 = PAdx
P delta V

## First Law of Thermodynamics
The increase in internal energy of a system is equal to the sum of the thermal energy added to the system and the work done on it.

q : positive thermal energy is added to the system 
q : negative thermal energy is removed from the system

 w : positive work is done on the system
 w : negative work is done by the system
