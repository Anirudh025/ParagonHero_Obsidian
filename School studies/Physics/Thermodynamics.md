Internal Energy = Kinetic Energy + Potential Energy

### For Ideal Gas![[Kinetic Energy Distribution of Ideal Gases]]

F = PA
If piston moves by distance dx

W = F dx
 = PAdx
P /delta V

## First Law of Thermodynamics
The increase in internal energy of a system is equal to the sum of the thermal energy added to the system and the work done on it.
