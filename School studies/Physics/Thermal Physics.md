# Temperature
Heat is a form of energy, energy :: the ability to do work
1.  Thermal Equilibrium 
	- When two objects at different temperatures are in contact with each other, heat flows from the hot object to the cold object. The flow of heat continues till both the objects are at same temperature. 
	- Thermal equilibrium is a dynamic process (The flow of heat continues in both directions without ever stopping)
## Thermometric Properties Of A Liquid
1. It must expand uniformly over a wide range of temperature.
2. It must have low melting point & high boiling point.
3. It must be clearly visible/opaque.
4. It must not stick to the glass tube.
