# Temperature
### Temperature scales
Heat :: a form of energy 
Energy :: the ability to do work 
1.  Thermal Equilibrium %%#physics/thermal_equilibrium%%
	- Thermal Equilibrium :: when two objects at different temperatures are in contact with each other, heat flows from the hot object to the cold object. The flow of heat continues till both the objects are at same temperature. 
	- Thermal equilibrium is a dynamic process (The flow of heat continues in both directions without ever stopping)
- Temperature :: Average Kinetic of measured object(s) 
###### Good thermometric properties:
 1. It must expand uniformly over a wide range of temperature.
2. It must have low melting point & high boiling point.
3. It must be clearly visible/opaque.
4. It must not stick to the glass tube.
5. It must have high density.

### Thermocouple Interplotation

To calibrate a thermometer :: Use melting and boiling point of ***pure water*** and mark temperatures uniformly between them %% #physics/thermocouple%%

### Empirical Scale of Temperature 
Empirical scale of Temperature formula :: $θ=\frac{100(P_θ-P_i)}{(P_s-P_i)}$
	- $P_s=$ :: Property of liquid at steam point
	- $P_i =$ :: Property of liquid at ice point
	- $P_θ =$ :: Property of liquid at point θ
Absolute Zero :: -273.15°C or 0K 
Celsius to Kelvin :: $TK = t°C + 273.15$ 
### Triple Point of Water
Triple Point of Water :: the temperature at which Ice, Water, Water vapour are in equilibrium 
### Specific Heat Capacity 
Specific Heat Capacity :: $\Delta Q = mc\Delta \theta$
Specific Heat Capacity (verbose) :: thermal energy required to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance by one degree.
### Specific Latent Heat
>[!note] The specific latent heat of fusion :: the quantity of thermal energy required to convert unit mass of solid to liquid without any change in temperature.
- The latent heat required to melt (fuse) a solid ::: known as latent heat of fusion.
	- Latent heat of fusion formula :: $\Delta Q = mL_f$
- The latent heat required to vaporise a liquid without any change of temperature ::: referred to as latent heat of vaporisation.
	- Latent heat of vaporisation formula :: $\Delta Q = mL_v$
>[!note] The numerical value of the specific latent heat of vaporisation is the quantity of thermal energy required to convert unit mass of liquid to vapour without any change in temperature.

Specific Latent Heat formula :: $\Delta Q = mL$ and units are $kJkg^{-1} == Jg^{-1}$
# Ideal Gases
State functions
1. Pressure P
2. Volume V
3. Temperature T
4. Moles n

## Gas Laws
### Boyles Law
Boyles' Law :: Keeping T constant, $P ∝ \frac{1}{V}$     $\therefore \space P_1 V_1= P_2 V_2$ 
![[Boyles Law.excalidraw]]
### Charles Law
Charles' Law :: When P constant $V ∝ T$    $\therefore \space \frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}$
![[Charles Law.excalidraw]]

### Gay Lussac
Gay Lussac' s law :: While V constant, $P ∝ T$    $\therefore \space \frac{P_1}{T_1}=\frac{P_2}{T_2}$
![[Gay Lussac.excalidraw]]

### General Gas Law  

$$PV ∝ T  \quad \quad \quad \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad    \frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}       $$
 General Gas Law :: $\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}$
 $R = 8.31JK^{-1} mol^{-1}$
units are JK<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>
