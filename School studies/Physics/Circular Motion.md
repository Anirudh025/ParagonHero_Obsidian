%% #physics/circularmotion The object performing the motion is always equidistant to the fixed point, r represents this distance from the centre of the circle
There is continuous change in velocity therefore there constant acceleration, thus there is a force required%%
Circular motion :: An object performing a motion such that the distance of the object from the fixed point remains constant
>[!example] An object performing circular motion moves from point A to B, covering an arc length S ![[circularmotion.excalidraw|350]]
>This is measured in radians

# Angular Displacement
$\theta = s/r$
Where $s = displacement$ and $r = angle$

 For one complete revolution:
 1. Total angle $= 360\degree$
 2. Total radians $= 2\pi$
$2\pi = 360$
$1 \space radian (rad) = \frac{360}{2\pi} = 57.3 \degree$

1 radian is the angle subtended at the center of the circle where the arc length is equal to the radius of the circle.

If $\theta = \frac{s}{r}$ 
- Linear velocity = $v = 2\pi \frac{r}{T}$, where 'T' is time period.
- Angular velocity= $\omega = \frac{2pi}{T}$
- $v = (\frac{2pi}{T}) * r$
- $v = r\omega$

Angular displacement:: angle subtended at the center of the circle
>[!info]- Any change in magnitude or direction of velocity is called acceleration
> Due to [[Laws of motion#2]]

Angular Displacement:: $\Delta\theta=\frac{s}{r}$
Angle of 1 revolution: $2\pi$
![[Angular Velocity.excalidraw|250]]     
$\Delta \theta =\frac{\Delta V}{V}$
$\therefore$
$\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{s}{r}$
$\Delta V = \frac{V}{r} \times s$
if we divide the equation by $t$ to create $a_c$ (centripetal acceleration)
$a_c = \frac{V}{$






during the circular motion there is no displacement in the direction of force hence the work done on the object is 0
