%%The object performing the motion is always equidistant to the fixed point, r represents this distance from the centre of the circle
There is continuous change in velocity therefore there constant acceleration, thus there is a force required%%
Circular motion :: An object performing a motion such that the distance of the object from the fixed point remains constant
>[!example] An object performing circular motion moves from point A to B, covering an arc length S ![[circularmotion.excalidraw|350]]
>This is measured in radians

# Angular Displacement
Theta = s/r
Where s = displacement and r = angle

 For one complete revolution:
 1. Total angle = 360 degrees
 2. Total radians = 2pi
2pi = 360
1 radian (rad) = 360/2pi = 57.3 degree

1 radian is the angle subtended at the centre of the circle where the arc length is equal to the radius of the circle.
