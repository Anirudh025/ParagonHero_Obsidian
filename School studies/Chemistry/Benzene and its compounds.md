## Benzene Structure
Benzene %% #chemistry/benzene %%:

1. It has planar symmetry and each bond has a length of 0.139nm
2. Each carbon atoms has 3 sigma bonds and 1 pi bond ![[benzenesigmapi.excalidraw|200]]
There is resonance in the benzene compound where the double bonds keeps switching from carbon to carbon, it looks like this

## Naming compounds
### General Names
1. When naming compound if carbon chain attached to benzene has more than 6 carbons:
	1. Benzene substituent is called Phenyl C₆H₅- %% #chemistry/phenyl %% 
		-  phenylhept-1-ane![[phenylheptane.excalidraw]]
	2. Benzene Parent is called {insertname}benzene 
		- 1-chlorobenzene![[chloro benzene.excalidraw|200]]
	3. When Benzyl substituent is present it's structure is %% #chemistry/benzyl %%:
		- benzyl R ![[benzyl.excalidraw|200]]
2.  When other functional groups are present benzene becomes the substituent:

# Reacting Benzene
###### By using Cl₂ with a catalyst of AlCl₃ 
We can create Chlorobenzene %% #chemistry/chlorination%%
	- ![[benzne+cl2 (alcl3).excalidraw|550]]
###### Benzene reacts with HNO₃ 
To form Nitrobenzene: %% #chemistry/nitration%%
	- ![[Reaction mechanism no2+benzene.excalidraw|600]]
###### Benzene reacts with  CH₃Cl 
to form methyl-benzene: %% #chemistry/alkylation%%
	- ![[Friedel Craft Alkylation of benzene.excalidraw|550]]
###### Benzene reacts with Ch₃C(O)Cl 
to form Phenylehtanone: %% #chemistry/acylation%%

###### Site Change Reaction of benzene: 
	- ![[Site change electrophyllic reaction.excalidraw|500]]
###### Oxidation of Benzene:
%% #chemistry/oxidation%%
	- ![[Oxidation of benzene.excalidraw|500]]
###### Hydrogenation of Benzene:

	- ![[Hydrogenation of benzene .excalidraw|500]]

==Due to its stability benzene does not undergo some of the addition reactions that other alkenes do==
