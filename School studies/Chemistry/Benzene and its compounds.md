1. It has planar symmetry and each bond has a length of 0.139nm
2. Each carbon atoms has 3 sigma bonds and 1 pi bond ![[benzenesigmapi.excalidraw|200]]
## Naming compounds
1. When naming compound if carbon chain attached to benzene has more than 6 carbons:
	1. Benzene substituent is called Phenyl C₆H₅- %% #phenyl %% 
		-  phenylhept-1-ane![[phenylheptane.excalidraw]]
	2. Benzene Parent is called {insertname}benzene 
		- 1-chlorobenzene![[chloro benzene.excalidraw|200]]
	3. When Benzyl substituent is present it's structure is %% #benzyl %%:
		- benzyl R ![[benzyl.excalidraw|200]]
2.  When other functional groups are present benzene becomes the substituent:

### Reacting Benzene
1. By using Cl₂ with a catalyst of AlCl₃ we can create Chlorobenzene 
	- ![[benzne+cl2 (alcl3).excalidraw|550]]
2. Benzene reacts with NO₂ to form Nitrobenzene: 
	- ![[Reaction mechanism no2+benzene.excalidraw|600]]
3. Benzene reacts with  CH₃Cl to form methyl-benzene:
	- ![[Friedel Craft Alkylation of benzene.excalidraw|550]]
4. Benzene reacts with Ch₃C(O)Cl to form Phenylehtanone: 
	- ![[Friedel craft Acylation of benzene.excalidraw|650]]
5. Site Change Reaction of benzene: 
	- ![[Site change electrophyllic reaction.excalidraw|500]]
6. Oxidation of Benzene: 
	- ![[Oxidation of benzene.excalidraw|500]]
7. Hydrogenation of Benzene: 
	- ![[Hydrogenation of benzene .excalidraw|500]]

==Due to its stability benzene does not undergo some of the addition reactions that other alkenes do== 
### Aromatic Compounds
**Aromatic Compounds** :: **Compounds are those that contain a ring of delocalized electrons**
Some Examples of Aromatic compounds are:
