# Physical-Quantity
- What is a physical quantity :: Anything that can be measured is a physical quantity 
- What All physical quantities consist of a numerical magnitude and a unit
- To represent a physical quantity, it must contain both a numerical value and the **unit** in which it was measured

# Scalar&Vector
- A **scalar** is a quantity which **only** has a magnitude (size)
- A **vector** is a quantity which has **both** a magnitude and a direction

# Errors
## Random-Error
- Random errors cause unpredictable fluctuations in an instrument’s readings as a result of uncontrollable factors, such as environmental conditions
- This affects the **precision** of the measurements taken, causing a wider spread of results about the mean value
- To **reduce** random error: **repeat** measurements several times and calculate an average from them
## Systematic-Error
- Systematic errors arise from the use of faulty instruments used or from flaws in the experimental method
- This type of error is repeated every time the instrument is used or the method is followed, which affects the **accuracy** of all readings obtained
- To **reduce** systematic errors: instruments should be **recalibrated** or the technique being used should be corrected or adjusted
## Zero-Error
- This is a type of systematic error which occurs when an instrument gives a reading when the **true reading is zero**
- This introduces a fixed error into readings which must be accounted for when the results are recorded

# Precision&Accuracy
- **Precision of a measurement:** this is how close the measured values are to each other; if a measurement is repeated several times, then they can be described as precise when the values are very similar to, or the same as, each other
- The precision of a measurement is reflected in the values recorded - measurements to a greater number of decimal places are said to be more **precise** than those to a whole number
- **Accuracy**: this is how close a measured value is to the true value; the accuracy can be increased by repeating measurements and finding a mean average
