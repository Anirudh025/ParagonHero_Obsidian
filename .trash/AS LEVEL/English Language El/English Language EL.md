# Pembroke
The advertisement has a key purpose of persuading and convincing the audience of possible travelers to stay at Pembroke, a luxurious apartment accommodation. Since the text is an advertisement paper a bias in the form of writing as only positive statements are listed and is in favour of persuading the readers to stay at Pembroke. The text us in the second person as pronouns like ‘your’ confirms it. The writer uses short paragraphs which prove a clear structure, with new information being provided in each paragraph. The text reflects a mood of relaxation, relaxation, tranquility and dreariness, as the location emanates a sense of such. The word ‘oasis’, suggestions that Pembroke is a paradise with comforts that are unimaginable to Attan. The 4th paragraph is one-liner which is a rhetorical device.
Paragraph 5, further emphasizes the purpose of the text to to persuade the reader that Pembroke is better than any other luxury accommodation in Cape Town. this can be backed up, as in paragraph 1, they mention that they are rubbing shoulders with an idiom, with two of the world's leading hotels. As to the lexical choice of the writer , he uses several adjectives when describing the apartment such as 'teal colour scheme'
etc. A similie is used in the last paragraph when the writer states 'lights of the marina shine like stars'. There is the excessive use of visual imagery as the location. Cape town and Pembroke, are described in depth visually comparative such as 'like' and the use of the idiom 'rubbing shoulders' are used to gauge comparison.
As the 6th paragraph begins, the writer seems to be taken on a tour of the interior of the apartment, from the bedroom to the dining room, lounge and kitchen areas along the way. These paragraphs are quite descriptive in nature an include several intricate details about the apartment.
The writer emphasizes luxury repeatedly and uses regal language such as 'shert', 'perfection' 'magnificent' and 'plush' which helps convince the readers that Pembtoke is the defination of peak luxury that is available to experience. this also introduces a sense of exclusivity and superiority. there are word classes used which all lead to the main idea of everything that is available in apparment . the tect is in the present tense, this can be verified with phrases/sentences that are in the present tense like 'there is an open plan dressing room' , etc. the vocabulary is quite regal in nature whuch once again convinces readers that pembroke has an establishes standard of luxury an royalty with a fusion of modernistic and futuristic build which makes the advertisement more apealing. 
# **2) Read the following text, which is an article from Australian food  website about a succesful pastry chef called Helen Goh
Analyse the text** 

the text is an article and is non-fictional in nature. It us a culinary article about a successful pastry chef called helen goh  and the audience is food enthusiasts and culinary critics. Paragraph 1 begins and talks about helen goh and introduces her along with another chef the text has several dialogue
exchanges such as 'I like to perfect classic things'. the text is in the third person narrative, this is backed up by 'she said'. The article is biographic and narrative in nature . the text does not necessarily follow a chronology. THe mood turns into a narrative toe with a bit of  tense, boredom and sadness. The phrase 'Unenthusiastically selling pills to doctors', acts as evidence of the mood being sad and repeated causing boredom  as helen was not interested in her job and doing it
