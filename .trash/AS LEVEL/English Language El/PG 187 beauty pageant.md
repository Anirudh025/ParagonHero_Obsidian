A beauty pageant is an event to showcase etiquette, glamour and the most important confidence. For any individual confidence is a make or break skill which can change the outcome of not only competitions but also improves social reIations. A pageant builds the confidence in girls, both young and old, to present themselves in front of a panel of judges while showing their meticulously created look. A suit of armor behind which lies a terrified little girl, but with the suit on she has confidence, through the self doubt and petrifying fear a burst of confidence erupts as a phoenix rises from the ashes. An aim to win and as fearless as lionesses the young women line up at a pageant to compete for the best.
