## A2
The boat floated in the rough seas as a feather gets knocked around by air. The waves rocked the boat to and fro, again and again, unrelenting battering as wave after wave crash into the small wooden boat. It's mast fell within the first hour of the storm, the sailors were stolen by the sea by hour three, picked off one after one by the wicked waves. The boat lay empty, holding off the endless beating of the waters with sheer determination as the rope held the wood together while being pelted by the seas. 

The pitter patter of rain pounding on the water and wood echoed in the stormy seas. Thunder rung overhead like canons booming in sky. The clouds wailed and bawled, their tears pattered onto the stormy seas. The rumbling thunder cracked in the sky, it's echoes intensified as if gunshots were fired in the air. The wind screeched through army of droplets racing to join the water below, howling into the air. The wooden boat creaked and shrieked as the waves blasted into it with a roaring crash. The sound of distant waves rising and smashing into the ocean sounded like bombs exploding in the distance, and their shock waves rocking the boat.

Bright lights flashed in the sky, bright as a star. It lit up the sky as a lamp would a dark cave, revealing the clouds for only a moment. A moment too long the clouds drooped low in the sky the dark contrast of the blinding darkness against the clouds light up by thunder painted the sky in gloomy shades of grey. When the lightning fell to the ground it lit up not just the sky, but the waves too. Like the tentacles of a kraken the waves rose to smash all in their way. The leviathan waves were tipped with white foam and painted a dark grey-green. Striking not just the boat, but all the fell under it's path of fury. 

As the storm raged on, the boat continued to be battered by the waves. The thunder and lightning provided brief glimpses of the ocean below, but the darkness between these flashes quickly swallowed up any sense of safety. The boat creaked and groaned under the strain, its mast having snapped off and its hull beginning to leak. Despite its efforts to stay afloat, it was clear that the boat was soon going to join it's crew beneath the waves. 
### Inspiration
The relentless assault of the storm continued, a symphony of chaos and power that played out on the open sea. The boat, now a mere puppet in the hands of the tempest, danced upon the tumultuous waves like a leaf caught in a wild river. Each wave was a force of nature's fury, crashing against the boat's sides with a thunderous boom that resonated through the wooden frame. The vessel seemed to shiver with each impact, its timbers protesting against the unyielding might of the sea.

The rain intensified, transforming from a mere pitter-patter to a torrential downpour that seemed to seek vengeance upon the very waters it fell upon. The sound was deafening, a constant drumming that echoed over the roars of the waves and the crashes of thunder. 

Amidst this chaos, the lightning continued to streak across the sky with blinding brilliance. Each flash illuminated the scene in stark relief, casting eerie shadows that danced and flickered across the churning waters. And then, just as quickly as the light had come, it would be plunged back into darkness, the void filled only by the haunting echoes of thunder.

The movement of the sea itself was a hypnotic dance of destruction. The waves, some towering as if seeking to touch the heavens, rose and fell in a mesmerizing rhythm. They surged forward with a raw, unrestrained energy, crashing against the boat with a force that seemed almost primal. The white froth that crowned their peaks contrasted starkly against the inky blackness of the night, an ethereal halo of demolition.

The boat's mast, once a symbol of direction and control, now lay broken and splintered, a casualty of the storm's unrelenting fury. The sailors who had manned the vessel had become part of the abyss, swallowed whole by the voracious sea. The rope, strained to its limits, held together the remnants of the boat, its fibers creaking in protest against the forces that sought to tear it asunder.
As time wore on, the boat's resilience began to wane. The constant barrage of the storm had taken its toll, and the vessel's strength was fading. The hull, battered and cracked, leaked water like a sieve, a constant reminder of its impending fate. Despite the valiant efforts of the rope, it was clear that the boat's fight was coming to an end.

In the midst of this maelstrom, It was a lone sentinel, weathering the storm with a stubborn refusal to succumb. The sound of the creaking wood and the howling wind was a symphony of defiance, a battle cry against the overwhelming power of nature.

And so, as the storm raged on, the boat's fate was sealed. The sea, a relentless force of nature, would claim its prize. The waves would finally have their victory, and the boat would join the depths below. But in its final moments, as the wind continued to shriek and the lightning continued to illuminate the chaos, the boat would stand as a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity in the face of overwhelming odds.
