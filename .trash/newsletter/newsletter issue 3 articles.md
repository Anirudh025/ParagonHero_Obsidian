## Global Issues
### Mental Health
In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, it's easy to overlook the importance of mental health. Yet, just like physical health, our mental well-being plays a crucial role in leading a fulfilling and balanced life.

Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also influences how we handle stress and relate to others . Maintaining good mental health isn't about the absence of mental illness; it's about building resilience, managing stress, and striving for emotional equilibrium.

The Stigma Surrounding Mental Health
Despite the increasing awareness of mental health issues, stigma still exists. Many individuals hesitate to seek help due to fear of judgment or misunderstanding. It's essential to challenge this stigma and create an environment where mental health discussions are encouraged, without judgment or discrimination.

Steps to Promote Mental Well-being
- Self-Care: Prioritize self-care by getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in regular physical activity. These basic habits lay a strong foundation for mental well-being.

- Connect with Others: Human connection is vital. Cultivate relationships with friends and family, and don't be afraid to share your thoughts and feelings.

- Seek Help When Needed: If you're struggling with your mental health, don't hesitate to seek professional help. Therapy and counseling can provide valuable tools for managing and improving your mental well-being.

- Practice Mindfulness: Mindfulness techniques, such as meditation and deep breathing, can help you stay grounded and reduce stress

Your mental health is as important as your physical health, if not more so. It's a dynamic journey that requires attention and care. By understanding and nurturing your mental well-being, you can lead a more balanced, resilient, and fulfilling life. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness, and you're never alone on this journey toward better mental health.
### ISRO
The Indian Space Research Organisation, commonly known as ISRO, was established in 1969 with the primary mission of developing India's self-reliant space program. Today, ISRO ranks among the world's six largest space agencies, playing a pivotal role in space exploration and technology advancement.

ISRO operates an extensive constellation of remote sensing satellites (IRS) and communication satellites (INSAT), which cater to the diverse needs of the nation. Its network of centers, offices, and research institutes spans across different regions of India, facilitating its multifaceted endeavors.

At its core, ISRO is dedicated to harnessing the potential of outer space for the benefit of India and humanity at large, engaging in cutting-edge science, engineering, and technology initiatives. As a crucial component of the Department of Space (DoS) under the Government of India, ISRO has achieved remarkable milestones in its journey.

In 1975, ISRO marked a significant milestone by constructing its inaugural satellite, named Aryabhata, which was subsequently launched by the Soviet Union. The agency's first indigenous launch vehicle, SLV-3, came to fruition in 1980, successfully deploying the Rohini satellite into orbit. The launch of the first INSAT satellite in 1982 further underscored ISRO's progress.

Throughout its history, ISRO has faced criticism and challenges, but it has consistently demonstrated its pioneering spirit and cost-effective technologies. This resilience and innovation have propelled ISRO into the ranks of elite space agencies worldwide, making it a source of pride for India's space exploration endeavors.

## Rakshabandhan 
Raksha Bandhan, a cherished Indian festival, celebrates the beautiful relationship between brothers and sisters. It is a day to express love, affection, and gratitude towards one another. Raksha Bandhan, also known as Rakhi, is a Sanskrit term that translates to "the bond of protection." It signifies the deep-rooted connection between siblings, where the brother pledges to protect his sister, while she, in return, prays for his well-being. Some of its rituals and traditions include the sister tying a thread around brother’s wrists. 
Then Sweets and delicacies are exchanged among the family members followed by a small aarti and tilak to bless the brother. Students of Witty International School celebrated this auspicious festival by crafting adorable rakhis out of materials such as beads, papers, etc. Raksha Bandhan is more than just a festival; it is a celebration of the enduring love and support that siblings provide each other. As the sacred thread is tied, it symbolizes not only the bond of protection but also the bond of love, trust, and companionship.
## Ganesh Chathurthi
Festivals and the environment.

Indian culture has its feet firmly steeped in tradition. It’s tradition’s name that paves the way for several age old traditions to look modernity right in the eye and coexist with it’s contrasting scientific breakthroughs. Discoveries have yielded certain ideas which lead to the rational mind questioning certain rituals and contemplating changes - at least those that sensitively navigate between the sentiments of religious practitioners and the conclusions of scientific breakthroughs sparking the concern for the environment in the first place. 

Be it Diwali, Holi or Ganesh Chaturthi, the environment pleads for eco-friendly celebrations- for example the use of flour to make the Ganpati idols, the use of fire crackers produced using potassium nitrate, and for colours to showcase their dominance over the use of water on the festival which highlights the prominence of good over evil- Holi. 

A wonderful opportunity to make an effort is just around the block- Ganesh Chaturthi.

As a student, take the road built for tiny steps - etch into your mind the severity of the harm caused by a lack of consideration, persuade the people close to you to follow the correct map and believe in the inherent ethical compass we all possess when unsure of the right route ahead.
